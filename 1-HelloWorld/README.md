#HelloWorld

The most simple demonstration of express.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

You will need brew to make things easier. Type ``` brew ``` on the command line to see if you have it installed. If you do not, install it with the following command. ``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```.

First we need to install node. This is a runtime environment for the javascript to execute in.  
```brew install node```

Next we need to install the node package manager. TODO: describe what this does.
``` brew install npm ```

Lastly, we need to install express, the javascript web framework we will be using.
``` npm install express ```
